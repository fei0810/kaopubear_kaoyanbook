今天让我们来看看苹果公司多么会挣钱。干货很多，务必仔细看。很多单词在真题中
都多次出现，务必仔细看！ 

题目：Apple posts the biggest quarterly profit in history 

（post做名词可以指工作，做动词在这里指 发布，公布，宣布且多跟利润/损失等, to officially record and announce information about a company's financial situation or a country's economic situation

例句：Cisco Systems posted record profits and sales for the third fiscal quarter. 思科系统公司公布了第三个财政季度创纪录的利润和销售情况。） 

US technology giant Apple has reported the biggest quarterly profit ever made by a public company. 

(giant 就是我们常说的巨头) 

Apple reported a net profit of $18bn (￡11.8bn) in its fiscal first quarter, which tops the $15.9bn made by ExxonMobil in the second quarter of 2012, according to Standard and Poor's. 

(net不要理解成网，在这里指:净的 net profit 翻译为净利润 这个短语在真题中是出现过的。) 

Record sales of iPhones were behind the surge in profits. Apple sold 74.5 million iPhones in the three months to 27 December - well ahead of most analysts' expectations. 

(从这两句句我们可以看出，利润的剧增主要来自于苹果手机的畅销，而且苹果手机的销量远远高于多数专家的预期。这里的 well约等于 very) 

In a conference call with financial analysts Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said that demand for phones was "staggering". 

executive 这个名词绝对是考研真题了经济类文章最爱出现的名词之一了，你必须要认识，指 a manager in an organization or company who helps make important

decisions〔机构或公司的〕主管，经理:例如 a marketing executive 营销主管 
今天你终于知道了 CEO究竟是个什么鬼,再也不是那个只知道 CEO 却说不出来全拼的土人了。

CEO就是 Chief Executive Officer: the person with the most authority in a large company总裁，首席执行官

The demand for Apple's larger iPhone 6 Plus model appeared to help boost profits and increase the iPhone's gross profit margin - or how much Apple makes per phone - by 2% to 39.9%. 

（gross profit margin是指毛利润率，希望你能把这三个单词都自己查查，真题中出现过不止一次。）
