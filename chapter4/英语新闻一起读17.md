★题目本身就很有意思，需要注意两个小词的用法，第一个是back，做动词有一个很重要的意思:支持，赞助government-backed loans政府担保的贷款；His claims are not backed by any scientific evidence.他的说法没有任何科学依据。Iranian parliament backs fuel rationing, price hike  (新闻标题)，还有一个单词是cut：削减，减少。cut costs 减少开支。

China's parliament has endorsed(认可，赞同) government plans to reduce the country's economic growth target by half a percent, to 7%.
