是的，昨天各大外国新闻的头条基本都是金将军，听说我们的朝鲜邻居进行了氢弹试验。今天也来稍微了解一下。

World shudders as North Korea claims it has tested first hydrogen bomb

> shudder : to shiver convulsively, as from fear or revulsion.形容因恐惧或感情突然变化而战栗。

The world moved to condemn North Korea after it said it carried out its first successful test of a miniature hydrogen bomb. Leaders from across the globe called on the dictatorship to call a halt to its nuclear weapons ambitions and fall into line with United Nations resolutions. Nato and EU leaders, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency and even North Korea's ally, China, called it a provocative act. Although earthquake monitors picked up signs of an explosion in the area of the blast, experts remained sceptical about whether North Korea had really created a hydrogen bomb.

> NATO: 北大西洋公约组织（North Atlantic Treaty Organization）

> condemn: 指责，谴责（道义层面）condemn sth / sb as sth;condemn sb / sth for (doing) sth .比如 condemn the needless waste of food（反对不必要的粮食浪费 ）

> miniature:微型的。 我们形容小孩子时会用一个词叫做“小大人”，英文可以用 miniature adults 来表示，

> ally: 在形容中国时用到了这个词，表示盟友，支持者。可以和它搭配的此不少，比如loyal, reliable, staunch，trusted。

> provocative act 挑衅性的行为。provocative 指挑衅的，煽动的。比如 provocative comment / remark 但是如果我们说一个姑娘笑的很provocatively，就不能翻译为笑的很挑衅了，而是笑得很撩人。

> pick up 这个短语意思比较多，比如捡起，开车接，发现，偶然学会等等。

> With the perfect success of our historic H-bomb, we have joined the ranks of advanced nuclear states.

According to North Korea, leader Kim Jong-Un personally signed the order three weeks ago authorising Pyongyang's latest nuclear test, saying he wanted 2016 to kick off with the "thrilling sound" of a hydrogen bomb explosion. The news was broadcast on state television, which also showed a copy of Kim's initial signed order dated December 15. South Korean officials and other analysts have cast doubt over the claims, saying the device had modest a yield of about 6 kilotonnes. "Given the scale, it is hard to believe this is a real hydrogen bomb," said Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum.

> kick off:本意是指足球比赛的中场开球，现在指一个活动或者事情的开始。表示“开始”还有一个更正式的词inaugurat，它的意思是开创，开辟.比如 inaugurate a period of high economic growth.开创一个经济高速发展的时代。这个单词同时也可表示开幕和正式就职。

> modest: 这个单词把握住“中间”这个本质的含义，如果说一个人，那就可以表示谦虚的，羞怯的；如果说一个数量，等级那可以表示适中的，适度的；如果形容一件衣服或者住所还可以是朴素的。

>They could have tested some middle stage kind (of device) between an A-bomb and H-bomb, but unless they come up with any clear evidence, it is difficult to trust their claim.
