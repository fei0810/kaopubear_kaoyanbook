"In an hour-and-a-half the fire is almost out on about 60 floors, it looks like mostly the outer apartments（公寓） that are damaged," eyewitness Rola told the BBC.She said it looked like the blaze started on the 50th floor. 

"It's an iconic building, people were out on balconies all around it watching - even though it was 3am (23:00 GMT Saturday)," she said.

"The civil defence came really quickly and they have said there were no casualties, everybody was told to evacuate in a timely manner and we think every body is OK."（画外音，这么高的楼着火竟然所有人都及时撤离没有伤亡，我们做得到么？） 

Cyrille Sekretev, who lives in the nearby Princess Tower, later told the BBC that all the residents of that building had been asked to evacuate but were later allowed to return. 
"I saw four floors on fire, then 20, then 60. It was very windy, so that really didn't help the situation. We were very scared that the wind would spread the fire."
