昨天我们分享的最新《经济学人封面文章选读①》介绍了目前男性在社会和工作中存在的一些问题，那么作者提出了哪些建议呢？今天我们来看一下这篇文章的后半部分。

考研写作很多时候需要我们提出自己的建议，我们来看看这篇文章是怎么写的，又可以学习到什么表达方法。

What can be done? Part of the solution lies in a change in cultural attitudes. Over the past generation, middle-class men have learned that they need to help with child care, and have changed their behaviour. Working-class men need to catch up. Women have learned that they can be surgeons and physicists without losing their femininity(女性气质). Men need to understand that traditional manual jobs are not coming back, and that they can be nurses or hairdressers(美发师) without losing their masculinity(阳刚之气).

首先作者认为我们应该改变文化态度，很多职业男人也可以胜任同时还不失自己的阳刚之气。

Policymakers also need to lend a hand, because foolish laws are making the problem worse. America reduces the supply of marriageable men by locking up millions of young males for non-violent offences and then making it hard for them to find work when they get out. A number of rich countries discourage poor people from marrying or cohabiting(同居) by cutting their benefits if they do.

其次作者建议政策制定者也应该采取行动，因为很多问题都是由于糟糕的政策带来的。

Even more important than scrapping(取消) foolish policies is retooling the educational system, which was designed in an age when most men worked with their muscles. Politicians need to recognise that boys’ underachievement(指学生的成绩不良) is a serious problem, and set about fixing it. Some sensible policies that are good for everybody are particularly good for boys. Early-childhood education provides boys with more structure and a better chance of developing verbal and social skills. Countries with successful vocational systems such as Germany have done a better job than Anglo-Saxon countries of motivating non-academic boys and guiding them into jobs, but policymakers need to reinvent vocational education for an age when trainees are more likely to get jobs in hospitals than factories.

另外，重建教育系统和职业培训系统也是必要的，应该加强对男生的教育让他们的学习成绩不要太差，也应该给那些学习成绩不好的男生提供更有效的职业培训。

More generally, schools need to become more boy-friendly. They should recognise that boys like to rush around more than girls do: it’s better to give them lots of organised sports and energy-eating games than to dose them with Ritalin(一种治疗多动症的药物) or tell them off for fidgeting. They need to provide more male role models: employing more male teachers in primary schools will both supply boys with a male to whom they can relate and demonstrate that men can be teachers as well as firefighters.

最后，作者认为学校应该对男生更友好，更适于男生学习和成长。理解男生好动的特点并增加男老师的数量。

The growing equality of the sexes is one of the biggest achievements of the post-war era: people have greater opportunities than ever before to achieve their ambitions regardless of their gender. But some men have failed to cope with this new world. It is time to give them a hand.(最后一段简单地道，句型结构和内容都可以积累)
