## 句、段

Students can reduce waste and limit their energy usage on campus in many ways. For documents that do need to be printed, students can use double-sided as opposed to single-sided printing. Furthermore, electricity usage can be limited by turning off computers before going to sleep and remembering to turn off the lights before leaving a room. Whenever possible, students should choose reusable products over disposable ones, such as spoons, chopsticks and refillable pens. Moreover, students should make an effort to buy products with packaging that is both recyclable and made from environmentally-friendly materials

在校园里，学生可以在很多方面减少浪费，限制能源消耗。对于论文和其他确实需要打印的文档，学生们可以使用双面打印来代替单面打印。此外，睡前关电脑、离开房间时记得关灯可以限制用电量。只要有可能，学生应该选用可反复使用的产品而不要用一次性产品，例如勺子、筷子和自动铅笔。此外，学生应该尽量买那些带有可循环包。

State leaders around the world have realized and acknowledged that we are likely to face a global energy shortage over the next few decades, especially in emerging economies like China and India. I believe governments can implement a number of practices to ease impending energy shortages. These include the promotion of energy-efficient practices, restrictions on energy use, and the provision of incentives for alternative energy.

全世界的国家领导人都已经意识到并且承认，在未来几十年里我们很可能会面临世界能源短缺，尤其是像中国和印度这样的新兴经济体更是如此。我相信政府能够采取很多措施来缓解迫在眉睫的能源短缺问题。这些措施包括提倡节能做法，限制能源消费，以及鼓励使用替代能源。

The most basic way in which a government can address the energy shortage is to better educate the public, particularly the younger generation, about the importance of conserving energy. The government can also ensure that the media play an active role in encouraging use of energy-efficient practices. This might include television campaigns to promote the use of bicycles instead of cars, or magazine and newspaper articles on the benefits of better home insulation.

政府应对能源短缺的最基本的方法就是更好地教育公众认识到节能的重要性，尤其是年轻一代。政府也可以确保媒体在鼓励利用节能措施方面发挥积极作用。这其中可能包括电视大规模的宣传，鼓励用自行车代替汽车，或者通过杂志和报纸文章宣传房屋密封性更好的益处。

In addition to the above mentioned measures, incentives for the development and use of alternative energies can also play an important role in mitigating the energy shortage.

除了以上提及的措施之外，鼓励替代能源的发展和使用也对缓解能源短缺有重要作用。

In the long run we must develop new sources of energy instead of merely conserving the known, limited supplies.

从长远来看，我们必须开发新的能源，而不是仅仅节约已知的有限能源。

### 2000年：商业捕鱼（漫画略）

As is shown in the pictures, with the rampancy of commercial fishing, the number of fish has dramatically shrunk. In the first picture, we learn that the year 1900 witnessed a quite encouraging scene of world fishing. There were various kinds of fish and only one fishing-boat. On the contrary, in the second picture, in 1995 there was only one fish swimming freely but many fishing-boats sailing in the sea. It is apparent that a disastrous change has occurred.

The purpose of the pictures is to tell us that due attention has to be paid to the reduction of ocean resources. Owing to the over-exploitation of marine resources, the number of fish has declined at an accelerating rate. If we let this situation continue as it is, we do not know where the fish will be in the future. By that time, our environment will suffer a great destruction.

Hence, it is imperative for us to take drastic measures to reverse this disturbing trend illustrated in the above pictures. For one thing, we should appeal to the authorities to make strict laws to control commercial fishing. For another, we should cultivate the awareness of people that ocean resources are of great significance to us. Only in this way can we protect our natural environment. I believe that we humans can surmount this difficulty and we will have a brilliant future.

如图所示，随着商业捕鱼的泛滥，鱼的数量已经显著下降。在第一幅图中，我们可以看到在1900年，世界捕鱼业是鼓舞人心的，画面上有很多鱼，但只有一艘渔船。而在第二幅图中，在1995年，只有一条鱼在游动，但有很多渔船在海上航行。

显而易见，灾难性的变化已经发生。这组图的目的是告诉我们应该对海洋资源的减少给予充分重视。由于海洋资源的过度开发，鱼的数量已经明显下降。如果听任这种情况发展，我们不知道鱼的未来在哪儿。到那时，我们的环境将会遭受巨大的破坏。

因此，我们急需采取严厉措施扭转图画中所示的令人困扰的趋势。一方面，我们应该呼吁各级政府制定严格的法律来控制商业捕鱼。另一方面，我们应该增强人们的意识：海洋资源对我们非常重要。只有这样才能保护我们的海洋资源。同时，我相信人类能够克服这个困难，并将拥有美好的未来。

### 2011年英语一：旅途之余（漫画略）

As is subtly portrayed in the cartoon, two tourists are taking sightseeing on a small boat while discarding their picnic leftovers casually into a lake. Unfortunately, the lake is already littered and teamed with flow rubbish like plastic containers, fish-bones, banana peel, watermelon rind, bottles, tins, food wrappings, and so on. And below the drawing, there is a topic which says: "after" the travel or "me" in the travel.

From the portrayal, we can conclude that the painter wants to convey such a message: a good many scenic spots are flooded with visitors, who spoil the beauty of nature by creating and leaving behind God-knows-how-much trash. On the one hand, tourism, as a multibillion-dollar business, is booming everywhere. Some people, laboring under the belief that tourism serves as an engine of economic growth, seem to ignore its negative effects on the environment. Nevertheless, these are not concerns that we can shrug off lightly. On the other hand, tourism has exerted great pressure on the environment we are living in: water is polluted, the ecological system is disturbed, and natural resources have been excessively used.

Undoubtedly, tourism could not be banned in any country as it does help to shore up the economy in places which have few sources of income. However, the significant point is that the unchecked growth of the travel business may render the development of an economy unsustainable. It is high time that we enhanced people's awareness to rectify this by taking the environmental protection into consideration.

如图所示，两名游客正在一艘小船上观光，同时把野餐的剩余垃圾随意丢入湖中。不幸的是，湖中已经堆满了漂浮的塑料盒、鱼骨、香蕉皮、西瓜皮、瓶子、罐头、食品包装等各种垃圾。在图画下方，有个小标题写着：旅程之“余”。

从漫画中，我们可以得出结论，画家想要表达这样一种信息：成群的游客涌入众多景点，制造并留下了大量的垃圾，破坏了自然之美。一方面，旅游业作为一项产值数十亿美元的产业，正在世界各地迅猛发展。有些人认为旅游业是经济发展的引擎，似乎忽视了其对环境的负面影响。然而，我们必须充分关注这一问题。另一方面，旅游业已经给我们生存的环境带来了巨大的压力：水受到污染，生态平衡遭到破坏，自然资源被过度开发。

毫无疑问，由于对那些几乎没有其他收入来源的地区而言，旅游业确实有助于发展经济，因此任何国家都无法禁止旅游业。但重要的是，旅游业毫无节制的发展可能使得经济发展不可持续。是时候加强人们的意识，通过多加考虑环境保护因素来改变这一现状了。

### 模拟题一

题目是一张显示PM2.5 标志的图片（图片略）

The drawing subtly reflects that air pollution is becoming increasingly serious in big cities. In the cartoon, there are a large number of cars, buses and trucks driving on the road, and the air quality is extremely bad. Meanwhile, a good many people are constantly coughing in their offices and homes. The magnifier reads: "PM 2.5".

Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the number of urban motor vehicles. Their emissions contribute significantly to air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities. The smog's most threatening aspect is its high concentration of PM 2.5—particulate matter that is small enough to lodge deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. No wonder that sometimes people have difficulty breathing or keep coughing.

In my view, it is imperative for us to take measures to reduce vehicle emissions, in terms of fuel quality and vehicle emission reduction technologies. Moreover, planting more trees can benefit air quality and the health of city residents.

这幅画微妙地反映了大城市的空气污染正在日益严重。在漫画中，大量的轿车、公交车和卡车行驶在路上，空气质量非常糟糕。同时，很多人在他们的办公室或家中不停地咳嗽。放大镜上写着“PM 2.5”。

近年来城市机动车的数量激增。机动车排放的尾气在很大程度上造成了空气污染，还是一些大城市烟雾形成的主因。烟雾中对人威胁最大的是高浓度的细颗粒物（PM 2.5），这种颗粒物小到足以进入到肺的深处并进入血流中。怪不得有时人们会感到呼吸困难或咳个不停。

在我看来，我们必须采取措施减少机动车的尾气排放量，可以从提升燃油的质量和发展减少机动车尾气排放量的技术这两方面入手。此外，多种树也对空气质量和城市居民的健康有益。

### 模拟题二（雅思考试范文）

题目：个人对于环境的改善无能为力，政府和大公司才能改善环境。你是否同意这样的观点。

It is an undeniable fact that in recent years, environmental pollution, which becomes increasingly serious, has aroused the shared concern of countries around the world. A group of people hold the viewpoint that governments and big companies, rather than individuals, should be mainly responsible for the improvement of the environment. Nevertheless, I am inclined to believe that governments, large companies, as well as individuals should actively shoulder the responsibility of beautifying the environment. In this essay, I will demonstrate my point of view from the following aspects.

Firstly, it is the responsibility of the government, representative of the people, to spare no efforts to ameliorate the environment. To be more specific, government should stage some relevant laws and regulations to severely punish factories which produce a great number of pollutants and those who litter or spit deliberately. Furthermore, large sums of money should be invested in the improvement of the environment, such as the treatment of waste water, trash recycling and so on.

In addition, large companies, on the other hand, should establish the self-consciousness to minimize the possibility of creating pollutants, which may not only be beneficial to the whole country but also to the companies themselves. As an illustration, some transnational corporations are striving to explore some newly-burgeoned industries of high-tech content, high additional value and low energy consumption, taking the place of some high contaminative industries.

Last but not least, it is the top priority of individuals to improve their living space. There is a popular saying which goes like this: “It is everyone’s obligation to protect the environment.” Most importantly, we should strengthen the consciousness of environmental protection, not only strictly being self-disciplined but also supervising people around. So to speak, it is unreasonable to claim that individuals have nothing to do with environmental protection. From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that government, big companies and individuals should make their due contribution to salvage the deteriorating environment.

不可否认，近年来，日益严重的环境污染问题引起了世界各国的共同关注。一些人认为政府和大公司应担负起改善环境的主要责任，而不是个人。然而，我认为政府、大公司和个人都应积极主动地担负起美化环境的责任。在这篇文章中，我将从以下几个方面论述我的观点。

首先，政府作为人民的代表有责任竭尽所能地去改善环境。具体来说，政府应该出台相关法律法规对制造大量污染物的工厂及故意乱扔垃圾、随地吐痰的人进行严惩。另外，应投入大笔资金来改善环境，比如污水的治理，垃圾的回收等。

此外，大公司应该自觉把制造污染物的可能性降到最小化，这对国家和公司本身都有很大的好处。例如，一些跨国公司正大力开发一些高技术含量、高附加值和低消耗的新兴产业来代替那些高污染的产业。

最后，个人应把改善我们赖以生存的环境作为头等大事来看待。就像一句很流行的话所说的那样：“保护环境，人人有责。”最重要的是，我们应该加强自身的环境保护意识，不仅要严格约束自己的行为，同时还要监督身边他人的行为。

因此，认为个人与环境保护毫无关系的想法是毫无道理的。

通过以上的论述，我们可以得出这样的结论：政府、大公司和个人都应做出应有的贡献来拯救日益恶化的环境。
