标题：Feeling impulsive or frustrated? Take a nap

★impulsive 易冲动的/repulsive 令人厌恶的

★frustrated 沮丧的

★nap 小睡 power-nap 白天恢复精力的小睡

Taking a nap may be an effective strategy to counteract impulsive behavior and to boost tolerance for frustration, according to a University of Michigan study.

It's becoming increasingly common for people, especially adults, to not sleep an entire night. This can negatively impair a person's attention span and memory, as well as contribute to fatigue.

★这一段关于熬夜危害的论述可以直接拿来背诵，如果想举一个网络的危害你可以说年轻人经常上网熬夜，如果写一个辞职信你可以说自己因为经常熬夜加班辞职，如果写生活习惯你可以说现在的年轻人经常熬夜。写作素材就是这么来这么用的。

★fatigue：疲惫

★contribute to：促进，对… 起作用

U-M researchers examined how a brief nap affected adults' emotional control. The study's 40 participants, ages 18-50, maintained a consistent sleep schedule for three nights prior to the test.

★participate：v 参加 →participants： n 参与者

In a laboratory, participants completed tasks on computers and answered questions about sleepiness, mood and impulsivity. They were randomly assigned to a 60-minute nap opportunity or no-nap period that involved watching a nature video. Research assistants monitored the participants, who later completed those questionnaires and tasks again.

★assist：v 帮助 →assistant ： n 助理 assistance：n 帮助，协助

Those who napped spent more time trying to solve a task than the non-nappers who were less willing to endure frustration in order to complete it. In addition, nappers reported feeling less impulsive.

Combined with previous research demonstrating the negative effects of sleep deprivation, results from the U-M study indicate that staying awake for an extended period of time hinders people from controlling negative emotional responses, said Jennifer Goldschmied, the study's lead author.

★hinder sb / sth \(from sth / from doing sth.阻碍；妨碍；阻挡≈hamper

"Our results suggest that napping may be a beneficial intervention for individuals who may be required to remain awake for long periods of time by enhancing the ability to persevere through difficult or frustrating tasks," said Goldschmied, a doctoral student in the Department of Psychology.

Napping may also be a cost-efficient and easy strategy to increase workplace safety, the researchers said. Employers who add nap pods in the workplace or offer extended break time may find their employees more productive.

★pod 本意是豆荚，可以指宇宙飞船的分离舱，在本文中 nap pod 就是我们平时说的可以小睡的休息室。
