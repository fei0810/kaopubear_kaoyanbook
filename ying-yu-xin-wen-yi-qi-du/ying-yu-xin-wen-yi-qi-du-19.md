A\|Anti-corruption 重拳反腐

The Chinese government has adopted a zero-tolerance approach in fighting corruption since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China \(CPC\) in November 2012. In 2015, China's top anti-graft watchdog（之间的新闻见过多次） said it will net more “tigers” and “flies” - corrupt government officials at both higher and lower levels - and combat graft in State-owned enterprises \(SOEs\). But how to build a long-term mechanism to supervise the exercise of official power requires suggestions from NPC deputies and CPPCC members.2012年11月的中共十八大以来，中国政府对待反腐采取“零容忍”的态度。2015年，中国反腐监察机构表示将继续“打虎拍蝇”，并开辟国企反腐的战场。但是，如何建立权力监督的长期机制，仍需两会代表献策建言。

B\|Breakup of Monopolies 破除垄断

Although China has eased market access in many industries and started SOE reforms in a bid to mobilize private investment and break monopolies, there is still a lot to do to achieve fair competition. Experts believe the private sector will reap more fruit this year.（注意这个比喻说法）尽管中国已经放宽许多行业的市场准入门槛并开始国企改革，以调动私人投资，破除垄断，但如何实现社会资源平等竞争还大有空间。专家预计，今年民营经济在这方面将有更多收获。

C\|Check of Power 简政放权

In the past two years, China's central government has prioritized the task of cutting red tape（官僚习气） and delegating power to lower-level governments. Altogether, 798 administrative approval items have been canceled or delegated to local governments. The move has curbed corruption and stimulated entrepreneurship（又是我们见过的老词）. More progress can be expected in the area.过去两年，中央政府简政放权成为改革重头戏，国务院累计取消和下放798项行政审批事项，有力地防止了腐败，激发了创业激情。这方面还会更有新进展。

D\|Democracy 中国式民主

In February, the CPC Central Committee published a document proposing to promote "consultative democracy". Consultative democracy - defined as a democratic pattern in which, led by the CPC, all sections of society are consulted on major issues before and during policy-making processes - helps Chinese people take part in the country's governance and makes sure that diverse voices can be heard and consensus can be reached. The two sessions are perfect examples of China exerting consultative democracy and offer a window for people to observe and understand China's democracy.（仿写作文素材 Sth. offer a window for people to observe and understand sth. ）2月，中共中央印发《关于加强社会主义协商民主建设的意见》，将协商民主定义为“在中国共产党领导下，人民内部各方面围绕重大问题，在决策之前和决策实施之中开展广泛协商，努力形成共识的重要民主形式。”而“两会”正是“协商民主”的绝佳体现，这为关注并试图理解中国式民主的人们提供了视角。

E\|Engines 经济引擎

In early 2015, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang put forward a fresh concept at Davos – “Two engines”: “To transform the traditional engine of growth by focusing on increasing the supply of public goods and services” and “To foster a new engine of growth by encouraging mass entrepreneurship and innovation.” In 2015, China is sure to take steps to fuel the "two engines" so that the economy can maintain a medium-to-high speed of growth and achieve a medium-to-high level of development.李克强总理在瑞士达沃斯年会上发表演讲时首次提出“双引擎”概念：一方面要改造升级传统引擎，扩大公共产品和公共服务的供给；另一方面要培育打造新引擎，推动大众创业、万众创新。2015年中国将采取措施为“双引擎”加油，使其释放能量助推中国经济保持“双中高”——实现中高速增长、迈向中高端水平。

F\|"Four Comprehensives" “四个全面”\(我天，这不就是我昨天发的政治内容么\)

CPC mouthpiece the People's Daily has carried a series of editorials prior to the annual legislative session, expounding the concept of the "Four Comprehensives", first raised by Xi Jinping in December. The concept includes comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society, deepening reform, advancing the rule of law and strictly governing the Party.（四个全面的英文表述） The concept, drawing wide spread attention from home and abroad, is expected to be the main theme of the legislative session.两会前， 《人民日报》发表系列评论，阐述习近平去年12月首次提出的“四个全面”——“全面建成小康社会、全面深化改革、全面推进依法治国、全面从严治党”。这个新提法受到了海内外的广泛关注，被认为将成两会“主旋律”。

G\|GDP 经济增长GDP（GrossDomestic Product）；

At the opening meeting of the NPC session on Thursday, Li Keqiang will reveal this year's GDP target when delivering the government workreport.

H\|Hong Kong 香港

2014 was an eventful year（多事之秋） for Hong Kong. The Shanghai-HongKong Stock Connect program kicked off trading. Guangdong and Hong Kong liberalized their service trade, and the Guangdong free trade zone \(FTZ\) was approved. Meanwhile, the illegal "occupy" protest movement negatively impacted Hong Kong's development and reform to its political system. Differences of opinion between people from the mainland and Hong Kong have surged.2014年对香港特别行政区来说喜忧交加：“沪港通”开锣、粤港基本实现服务贸易自由化、广东自贸区获批；与此同时，长达两个多月的“占中”非法集会也对香港的发展与政制改革带来不良影响，两地人员交流往来也出现了一些摩擦。

I\|Innovation 创新

Innovation is an engine to China’s development, and reform is an ignitor to the engine. As the economy enters a "new normal", and growth slows, China's economy will rely more on innovation to drive its growth.创新是中国发展的新引擎，而改革是必不可少的点火器。在经济步入新常态、增速明显放缓的大趋势下，中国经济更加需要依靠创新驱动。

J\|Jobs 就业/创业

N\|New Normal 新常态

"New normal" is a buzz word in 2014 and it will be the first appearance of the word at the two sessions since it became a guideline for Chinese leaders in economic policy-making.“新常态”名列2014年度中国十大新词语榜首，并已经成为领导人制订经济政策的依据。今年两会，是“新常态”一词成为政策话语后的第一次两会。

O\|Opening up 开放

China became a net\(net 表示净已经提过很多次了\) foreign investor for the first time in 2014. However, foreign capital still plays a vital role in the Chinese economy, especially in improving the quality and efficiency of growth and in driving innovation. In 2015, China will further open up its service sector, guided by experience distilled from the Shanghai Free Trade Zone.2014年，中国第一次成为对外净投资国。但是，外资对中国经济仍然必不可少，特别体现在经济提质增效和创新驱动发展等方面。2015年，中国将继续扩大多个领域对外开放，同时推广上海自贸区经验。

P\|Pollution 污染问题

“We will resolutely declare war against pollution as we declared war against poverty,” said Premier Li Keqiang at the parliamentary sessions last year. A poll has showed that pollution control and environmental protection remains one of the biggest areas of public concern ahead of the two sessions.“我们要像对贫困宣战一样，坚决向污染宣战。”去年两会上李克强总理的这句话掷地有声。网调显示，污染问题和环境治理是今年两会前最受公众关注的话题之一。

Q\|Quality 质量

The country is embarking on（着手） a development path characterized by efficiency, quality, sustainability and steadiness.中国表示将不再简单追求增长速度，而将在转型升级与保持合理增长区间内找到一个黄金平衡点，追求有效率、高质量、可持续、更稳健有力的发展。

The two sides also released the landmark China-U.S. Joint Announcement on Climate Change. Reporters will try to get some hints on how China and the United States will rise above their differences.习近平主席将于今年9月应邀对美进行国事访问。去年中美就签证互惠、军事互信、贸易谈判等问题达成多项协议与共识，还发表了具有里程碑意义的《中美气候变化联合声明》。未来两国如何拓展合作、管控分歧，各国记者们很可能借两会场合一探究竟。

Z\|Zone 自贸区

A year and a half after the launch of the pioneering Shanghai FTZ, similar FTZs in Guangdong, Fujian and Tianjin have been approved and may have an official kick-off very soon. Experts say they are not simple copies of the Shanghai FTZ, but more regionally integrated, targeted, and differentiated in their functions.中国首个自由贸易试验区正式于上海挂牌近一年半后，粤闽津三个新设自贸区正式挂牌之日渐近。专家认为新一批自贸区并非对上海自贸区经验的简单复制，而是区域化特征明显、目标指向性更强，走差异化道路。
