New study shows that red wine could help you lose weight 作者：Twitter, businessinsider.com

New research claims that berries（浆果）, grapes and other fruits can help cut down the type of fat that leads to weight gain. Researchers believe that the study findings could help devise a strategy for the treatment and prevention of obesity.

★cut down：减少

★obesity：肥胖 外刊例句Insufficient sleep contributes to the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. 睡眠不足会引发心血管疾病、糖尿病及肥胖病发风险。

According to a research team at Washington State University, daily intake of fruits helps convert weight-gaining "white" fat into calorie-burning "beige" fat. This, in turn, prevents an increase in weight.

★convert ：~ into / to sth可转变为；可变换成。使物质的性质、形态、功能发生改变；使人的信念信仰发生改变。 →controvert：否认，反驳→controvertible可争论的：→incontrovertible：不容置疑的; 无可辩驳的≈indisputable

During the study, researchers provided a high-fat diet to the subject mice. A few mice were supplied with resveratrol（白藜芦醇）, an antioxidant commonly found in almost all fruits. The amount of resveratrol given to the mice was equivalent to between two and three servings of fruits per day for humans.

The researchers noticed that the mice who consumed resveratrol ultimately gained 40 percent less weight than the mice who were not fed resveratrol. Researchers believe that due to resveratrol, the mice were able to convert white fat into beige or brown fat, preventing weight gain. The team believes that similar polyphenols（多酚类） in different fruits might also help in oxidation（氧化） of body fat.

“They convert white fat into beige fat which burns lipids \(fats\) off as heat, helping to keep the body in balance and prevent obesity and metabolic dysfunction（新陈代谢紊乱）. We are using resveratrol as a representative for all the polyphenols,” said lead researcher Professor Min Du in a statement.

In addition to berries and grapes, apples and red wine also contain resveratrol. However, grapes have the highest amount of the polyphenol. The study findings have been published in the International Journey of Obesity.
