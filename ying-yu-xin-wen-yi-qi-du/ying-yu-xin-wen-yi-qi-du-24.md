The capital leads the way in banning smoking in public places

★ lead the way in doing sth.率先做某事

AT LAST year’s ten-day annual session of the National People’s Congress \(NPC\), China’s rubber-stamp\(这个词不是什么好意思，但是形容的听恰当\) parliament, the prime minister, Li Keqiang, declared “war” on pollution. On March 15th, at the end of this year’s meeting, he admitted that government efforts were falling far short of public expectations. He failed to mention that on controlling one source of foul air—smoking—the government’s record has been worse.

They are also tougher than the capital’s existing widely ignored rules, which specify much lighter penalties\(处罚\) \(eg, ten yuan for smoking in the wrong place\).

Chinese leaders are becoming more focused on the problem. In 2013 officials were banned from smoking in public places. President Xi Jinping’s wife is a “tobacco-control ambassador” for a government-affiliated \(这个词挺重要，但之前讲过\)campaign group. In February Li Keming, the prime minister’s brother, was removed from a senior position in the state tobacco monopoly \(重点词\)and assigned to another job, a move cheered by those who worried about conflicting
