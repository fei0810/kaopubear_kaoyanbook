Windows 'open' for Apple and Android

2015年4月30日 BBC

Microsoft is keen to sell its mobile devices

★keen to do sth. 可以翻译成：渴望做某事或者迫切的想要做某事。

keen 作为形容词时可以表示“灵敏，敏锐的”，同时可以表达一种“加强的”情感，比如在不同的语境下可以翻译成“渴望的，强烈的，着迷的，激烈的”等意思。

外刊例句：I leap out of bed each morning, keen to start an active day.

我每天都很早从床上跳起来，迫切而积极地开始一天的生活。

We are very keen to looking forward to increasing that partnership.

我们期待未来进一步加强这一伙伴关系。

Microsoft is releasing software tools that make it easier to run popular Apple and Android apps on Windows mobile devices.

★学长说：WP系统因为其应用数量有限被很多人诟病，看来现在他们要有所行动了。

★device: n 装置

说到这个词大家顺便掌握下面几个词:

home appliance\(拜托不要翻译成家里的装备哈\)

Equipment/installation/infrastructure

By changing a "few percent", Apple app makers should be able to run code on Windows 10 mobile devices, it said.

And many Android apps should run with no changes.

Experts said the move was an "imperfect solution" to Microsoft's problems persuading people to use Windows mobile.

★persuade: 劝说，劝服—convince

For iOS, Microsoft has unveiled an initiative called Project Islandwood, which has led to the creation of a software interpreter that works with the development tools Apple coders typically pick.

★veil:n 面纱；v 掩盖→unveil: v \(首次\)推出，公布

★interpret：解释说明；口译→interpreter 口译员，在计算机领域要翻译为“解释程序”

★pick这个小词讲过很多遍，用法非常广泛。还不知道的可以去翻翻词典。

By piping code through this interpreter and changing a few other parts, it would be possible to transfer or port\(计算机领域 名词为端口 动词为程序的移植\) iOS apps to Windows 10, Microsoft said in a presentation at its Build developer conference in Seattle.

Already developers working for game-maker King have ported the massively popular Candy Crush Saga\(你可能玩过这个游戏，叫做糖果传奇\) to Windows using these tools.

A separate initiative, called Project Astoria, is aimed at Android and involves code built in to Windows itself that spots when an Android app is running and gives it the responses it expects.

Microsoft said this meant many Android apps would run with no changes on Windows mobile devices.

However, the way that Android is built means changes will have to be made to some apps.

The tactic is seen as a way for\(写作句型\) Microsoft to boost its popularity and persuade developers to include Windows 10 in their plans.

★boost：增强，提高

take action to boost the economy采取行动促进经济发展。a range of measures to boost tourism.推动旅游业发展的一系列举措。

Intensive reading did a lot to boost my confidence in English learning.精读文章增加了学习英语的信心。\(你有没有这种感觉\)

While many apps are already available on the Windows store, some popular ones, such as Pinterest and Plants v Zombies 2, are absent.

Microsoft has also added tools that let Android apps reach some parts of Windows, such as its Cortana\(安卓系统的语音助手\) personal assistant, they would not otherwise be able to use.

CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber said: "The decision to embrace Android and iOS applications is an imperfect solution to an undesirable problem.

"Nonetheless, it's a necessary move to attract developers otherwise lost to Apple and Google."

★otherwise:还记得我们之前学习过这个词在不同的语境下如何翻译么？想不起来的翻翻前面的微博吧。

★另外，这句话稍加变动就可以变成一个很好的写作句型：The decision/measure to …… is an imperfect solution to an undesirable/this problem. Nonetheless, it's a necessary move to …… .
